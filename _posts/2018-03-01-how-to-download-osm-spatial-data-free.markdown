<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>penStreetMap is open and free. This means, OSM is not charging any fees to use its data. OpenStreetMap can be customized. All datasets in OpenStreetMap can be used to your own needs, for instance, if you need to make tourism sites map in your place, you can take OpenStreetMap data and show only these tourism destinations without having to include other information.</p>
